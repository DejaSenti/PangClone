Pang clone assignment for Comunix by Tom Lyden
==============================================

* Make sure you build the level asset bundles before making the actual build! This is done in the editor by going to Assets => Build AssetBundles

For this task I chose the following bonuses:
* Design the game using the MVC paradigm
* Implement easy addition of different levels (and make 5 of them)
* Implement support of local screen multiplayer (PC only)

I chose those bonuses due to their apparent importance to the task (++ and +++) and my familiarity with the needed concepts to implement them.
Due to lack of time, I preferred not to focus on audio, visuals, and leaderboard saving as these would have taken me some time to research and do properly.
It seemed more important to me that the game was playable and flexible, with easy addition of levels and multiplayer support, and that the code is readable, accessible and maintainable.
